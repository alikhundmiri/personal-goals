## Things I'll Do Next Week

## Week In Review

My week was going pretty well, until I came down with a bug which knocked me out Thursday through Sunday. The weather was beautiful during those days and topped out at 70F (of course).

I didn't get as much done from my list as I wanted, but I took advantage of not feeling well to get a bunch of busywork done. 

An old server of mine crashed so I was forced to update it which made realize I was actually paying for two servers which I rarely use anymore. It won't save me a ton of money but it will save me some money (:moneybag:).
