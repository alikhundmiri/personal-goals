## Next Week's Focus: **Leadership**
Next week, I want to take a leadership role in the various areas of my work and volunteer life that are slipping away from me. I'm going to be more micro in my tracking of myself, and more macro in how I deal with others. By this I mean I'd like to examine my interactions with others to make sure I'm leaving them room to have their own opinions, express them, and get their needs met. I want to enable people to get things done, and enable myself to get things done, too.  

I also want to lead Lacey to better health. (And now I sound like a lifestyle coach or a MLM person or something.) Butt I want to practice discipline in yoga, in meditation, in being in the moment. And I want to take some time off for my friend's visit.

## Week In Review

This was sort of a rough week. I felt like I was dancing as fast as I could, and nothing was getting done. It helps to see the list of things I checked off, however my day job suffered for conference and workshop organizing,  my DjangoCon Europe talk still has a long way to go before it's done, and I have some contract work that has stalled. Things will be much easier when March is over. 

But let's focus on the good! We recruited Andy for DjangoCon, I did a few rounds of yoga, and I started using Headspace. I also did some intense binging of The Amazing Race while working, and I think I've reached my limit on that.
