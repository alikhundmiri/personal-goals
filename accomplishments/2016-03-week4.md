## Week In Review

My four days in Vienna were amazing, but were very exhausting. I had not underestimated how difficult it would be to travel on my own. I had pretty bad decision fatigue by the last day, and spent most of it in a coffee shop reading to give my brain a break. 

I particularly enjoyed the Albertina Museum, especially the [Anselm Keifer](http://www.albertina.at/en/anselm_kiefer) exhibit. I can't wait to come back to Vienna again with Donald sometime. 

In Budapest, I had so many wonderful conversations with new friends. I also got to pair with [Katie](http://twitter.com/glasnt), who I hope will become a very good friend!
