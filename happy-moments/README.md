## 2016

S and I won the "Most Creative" prize for the website we made! :trophy:

Katie wrote me an awesome recommendation on LinkedIn, and then I wrote a bunch of other people recommendations, and then I felt full of goodwill.

Finally got something off my plate that I've been working on for weeks, and that kept getting pushed down to the bottom. I also resigned from an organization that I love, but that I don't have time for. I feel good about that decision. And I worked from a pub close to my house, where I learned that I like lemon-ginger kombucha! :lemon:

Made a website with S, which was awesome. It wasn't our whole outing, and she's only 8 so I don't think she would have had the patience for that. But we spent about 40 minutes between dinner and a play putting together a website to show off the photos from our BBBS photo scavenger hunt, and she had a basic grasp of CSS and how to change text and background colow by the end. She thoroughly enjoyed it.

Prince died yesterday, so on the way home I made her listen to some classics. She rated them as follows (on a scale of 1 to 10):

- Kiss: 5
- The Most Beautiful Girl in the World: 4
- When Doves Cry: 6
- Let's Go Crazy: 1 (but it was a live version and not recorded well, so this hardly counts)
- Purple Rain: 3

I clearly have some work to do.

I received a :love_letter: happiness packet today :heart:

A colleague and I had a meeting about a project we are both working on that we are really nervous about, and he said to me, "You know, sometimes I get really scared that we're just going to fail. But then I feel better because you and [other coworker] are really smart, so we'll be okay." This colleague is really senior compared to me, so it meant a lot to hear that from him!

The feedback from my talk was amazing! Also, I made my first commit (and I do hope not my last) to Russell's Batavia project. It was small, but I got to ring the gong at the DjangoCon Europe sprint.

Today, I've been married for two years. Marriage is hard but wonderful, and I'm feeling so lucky to have the partner I do.  

I also had a long, personal chat with a good friend today, and felt very connected to them. I think I was helpful.

I am so excited about my talk! I finally got into a writing groove today, and it felt good. Trying to do the slides first was a bad idea. I'm too verbal. I should always start with the words.

Filled out a :basketball: bracket today. Just for the hell of it. Going skiing tomorrow!

Had a much-needed text-chat with the BFF this morning.

Conference sprinting is fun!

Finished the Shamrock Run 5k without stopping! I took almost 40 minutes, and it rained the whole time, but I didn't stop to walk even once. I am so, so proud of myself. :shoe:

After 30 minutes of yoga and 10 minutes of meditation, I felt peaceful. It didn't last long, but it was there.

Donald sent me a video of this [toddler snowboarder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6O3yBa0BfM&feature=youtu.be), and it's adorable. :ski:

Woke up with a headache, so I did good self-care. I took some Aleve, had a cup of coffee, took a shower, and did 20 minutes of yoga. The headache isn't gone, but it's better.

Woke up two two nice tweets about myself! [This one](https://twitter.com/glasnt/status/707123571378683904) from [Katie McLaughlin](https://twitter.com/glasnt), and [this one](https://twitter.com/webology/status/707234225313873920) from [Jeff Triplett](https://twitter.com/webology).

I think we recruited someone for Diversity Chair for DjangoCon US! Also, someone said they were happy to be working with me again for DjangoCon US, and that felt really good.

Had a nice long conversation with my friend Brit. Might try to spend a week with her in Austin in May.

Donald and I took S sledding for the first time. She was so brave, and didn't complain once!
