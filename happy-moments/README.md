Woke up with a headache, so I did good self-care. I took some Aleve, had a cup of coffee, took a shower, and did 20 minutes of yoga. The headache isn't gone, but it's better.

Woke up two two nice tweets about myself! [This one](https://twitter.com/glasnt/status/707123571378683904) from [Katie McLaughlin](https://twitter.com/glasnt), and [this one](https://twitter.com/webology/status/707234225313873920) from [Jeff Triplett](https://twitter.com/webology).

I think we recruited someone for Diversity Chair for DjangoCon US! Also, someone said they were happy to be working with me again for DjangoCon US, and that felt really good.

Had a nice long conversation with my friend Brit. Might try to spend a week with her in Austin in May.

Donald and I took S sledding for the first time. She was so brave, and didn't complain once!
