# Project Ideas

##  Ideas
1. Sorting Hat in Django
2. Slackbot that onboards new DjangoCon organizers. Simpler version of the [Mrs. Landingham bot ](https://github.com/18F/dolores-landingham-bot) at 18F.
3. Script to get all my #twosentencehorrorstories posts from Facebook and put them in a spreadsheet. 
4. Website for learning to program. Would collect free resources for Python, Ruby, JS, etc. and then show people lists of free resources. Good chance to use Hugo or other static site generator. 
5. Django Girls tutorial but for React. Teach people just enough vanilla JS to be able to write a basic React app.
