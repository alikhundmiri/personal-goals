# Project Ideas

##  Ideas
1. Sorting Hat in Django 
2. An app that lets you track your period, your weight and fitness stuff, your mood, etc. all in one. Sort of like [Nomie](http://nomie.io/) but with period tracking and predictions, or like [Glow](https://glowing.com/) but with customizable things you can track. 
3. Slackbot that onboards new DjangoCon organizers. Simpler version of the [Mrs. Landingham bot ](https://github.com/18F/dolores-landingham-bot) at 18F.
