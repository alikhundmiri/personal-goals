# Personal Goals

Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

## Overarching Goals

1. Be Heathy
2. Get work-life balance back in check
3. Less stress
4. Write more (blog + emailing friends)
5. Get better at cooking
6. Re-start morning coffee + writing sessions
7. Learn Ukulele / Guitar
8. Learn React + [Javascript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)

10. Save Money
11. Shoot more photos
12. Write a game
