# Personal Goals

Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

## Overarching Goals

1. Be Healthy
2. Get work-life balance back in check
3. Less stress
4. Write more (blog + emailing friends)
5. Cook more
6. Learn Ukulele / Guitar
7. Learn React + [Javascript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)
8. Reach out to friends more
9. Save Money
10. Shoot more photos
11. Write a game
12. Improve my posture
