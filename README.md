# Personal Goals

Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

## Overarching Goals

1. Be healthy and fit 
1. Get work-life balance back in check
1. Less stress
1. Save money
1. More friend time
1. Learning: Spanish 
2. Learning: Python 
3. Improve impostor syndrome
