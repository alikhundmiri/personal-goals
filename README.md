# Personal Goals

Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning. [See what I'm working on on my Trello board](https://trello.com/b/mQmS0lDa/personal-todo) for further experiments in radical transparency! 

## Overarching Goals

1. Health
2. Spouse
2. Friends 
1. Work-life balance 
1. Less stress
1. Increase assets 
1. Learning: Python, Django, Spanish
3. Improve impostor syndrome
