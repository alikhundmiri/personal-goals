Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

## Overarching Goals

2. Spouse
2. Friends 
1. Work-life balance 
1. Less stress
1. Increase assets 
1. Learning: Python, Django, Spanish
3. Improve impostor syndrome

### This Week's Focus: :white_check_mark: Checklist Manifesto All the Things 

I didn't have a lot of success with :fr: WWAFWD. It was also a really rough week. I'm still not getting exercise as regularly as I would like to. Oddly, I also want to replace my FitBit, which I never really wore anyway. Maybe I should get one of the bracelet ones, as opposed to the ones you clip onto your bra or to your pocket? 

This week, I'm going to experiment with writing checklists for various parts of my day in an effort to have more balance and make progress on the things I want to make progress on. We'll see how that goes. What I'm doing is only semi-working for me right now. Time to iterate!
