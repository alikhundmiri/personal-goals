[Soundslice](https://www.soundslice.com) is using service workers to enable an offline mode. According to Adrian Holovaty in his 2016 DjangoCon Europe presentation, this technology could be used to enable users to work on long forms offline, allowing them to save their answers and get them to the database once connectivity is restored.
