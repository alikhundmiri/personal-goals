### Amazon's Help page

The headers are large and easy to read, and the most popular problems in each section are bulleted below. They also allow the user to search for their particular issue, enabling the user to help themselves!

### The Common App 
[The Common App](https://www.commonapp.org/) has a section for parents that shows them what their kid will be doing. It guides them through creating an account, starting an app, etc. ApplyTexas gets a lot of parent questions, so this might be helpful.

## Neat Stuff 

### Soundslice 
[Soundslice](https://www.soundslice.com) is using service workers to enable an offline mode. According to Adrian Holovaty in his 2016 DjangoCon Europe presentation, this technology could be used to enable users to work on long forms offline, allowing them to save their answers and get them to the database once connectivity is restored.
