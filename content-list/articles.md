Things I've read online that have stuck with me for one reason or another. 

## Diversity 

### [Monica Lewinsky: ‘The shame sticks to you like tar’](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/16/monica-lewinsky-shame-sticks-like-tar-jon-ronson)

> [M]isogyny is still thriving. When the Guardian began researching the online harassment of its own writers, they discovered something bleak: of the 10 contributors who receive the most abuse in the comment threads, eight are women – five white, three non-white – and the other two are black men. Overall, women Guardian writers get more abuse than men, regardless of what they write about, but especially when they write about rape and feminism. I noticed something similar during my two years interviewing publicly shamed people. When a man is shamed, it’s usually, “I’m going to get you fired.” When a woman is shamed it’s, “I’m going to rape you and get you fired.”

### [The Pizza of Privilege: My Experiences with Anti-Semitism in Academia](http://www.southernfriedscience.com/the-pizza-of-privilege-my-experiences-with-anti-semitism-in-academia/)

> I once asked if I could, at my own expense, provide dreidels, a menorah, and latkes (a Hanukkah food) at a graduate school  “holiday party” that was going to consist primarily of singing Christmas Carols and hanging ornaments on a Christmas tree while wearing sweaters featuring Santa Claus. (ProTip: If you call something a “Holiday Party” but every single other detail of the party is identical to a stereotypical “Christmas Party,” this is not an example of inclusiveness.) I was told by a fellow graduate student (not the official organizer for the party) that I should “leave my weird traditions at Jew Church” and “let people celebrate the real holiday in peace.”

## Tech 

### [Lost In Translation: Study Finds Interpretation Of Emojis Can Vary Widely](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/12/473965971/lost-in-translation-study-finds-interpretation-of-emojis-can-vary-widely?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=npr&utm_term=nprnews&utm_content=20160412)

> "We find that only 4.5 percent of emoji symbols we examined have consistently low variance in their sentiment interpretations," the researchers write. "Conversely, in 25 percent of the cases where participants rated the same rendering, they did not agree on whether the sentiment was positive, neutral, or negative."

### [Working in public from day one](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/07/31/working-in-public-from-day-1/)

> You will make better decisions. At the most basic level, you will be vastly less likely to accidentally commit a password to an open source project than a closed one. But more than that: even though no one is reading your code, you'll still feel a bit of natural pressure to make better decisions. You'll hardcode less, and move more into configuration files. You'll make things slightly more modular. You'll comment more. You'll catch security holes more quickly. That's a healthy pressure.

## Just Nice Things 

### [Iceland’s Water Cure: Can the secret to the country’s happiness be found in its communal pools?](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/24/magazine/icelands-water-cure.html?partner=IFTTT&_r=2)

> These public pools, or sundlaugs, serve as the communal heart of Iceland, sacred places whose affordability and ubiquity are viewed as a kind of civil right. Families and teenagers and older people lounge and chat in sundlaugs every day, summer or winter. Despite Iceland’s cruel climate, its remoteness and its winters of 19 hours of darkness per day, the people there are among the most contented in the world.
