# Today I Learned (TIL)
- **4/6/16**: [How to generate a requirements.txt file](http://www.idiotinside.com/2015/05/10/python-auto-generate-requirements-txt/)
- **3/9/16**: That flowcharting is an excellent way to begin the refactoring process. Combining two functions into one was made so much easier by starting with design.

# Stuff I want to learn
There is a lot of stuff I don't know. Some of it is embarrassing to list. But the goal of this project is to make my personal goals public. Putting the embarrassing things I don't know, but would like to make time to learn, out in public will help keep me motivated and accountable!
